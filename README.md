ABOUT FAKEX-PYTHON

This library was built as a backup to forex-python, in the event that the API 
goes down and our students need to use a forex library.

It uses a static list of example exchange rates and is NOT accurate or 
up-to-date. This is for practice/educational purposes only and should not be 
used in any sort of official/professional capacity.
